This repository contains the python notebooks, powerpoint presentations and project report pdfs of a group project on Customer Classification for the Data Science Internship at Data Glacier. The contributions for the code and report/presentations are from my team member, Amira Asta and myself.The project is about a classification problem.

## Problem statement:
A bank wants to increase its financial revenue stream and hence it is offering a term deposit plan to its existing clients to purchase. This will give a financial stability to the bank because of the cash inflow, and it will also be able to invest any other financially lucrative scheme.

## Task:
Our task is to help the bank by coming with a classification model which predicts which customers would opt for this product, and to understand the profile of such customers whom the bank's marketing team could target through different media channels.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
The EDA summary done on this data is in a PowerPoint presentation - Week11_EDA_presentation.[Week11_EDA_presentation.pdf](https://github.com/Vatsal-2414/Bank-Marketing-Campaign-DSEnthusiasts2021/files/10827548/Week11_EDA_presentation.pdf)
